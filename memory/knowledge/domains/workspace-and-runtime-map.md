# Workspace and Runtime Map

## Purpose

Define where policy/runtime files live and how materialized workspace paths are interpreted.

## Durable Map

- Runtime entry context is anchored by `../references/anchors/.hermes.md`.
- Workspace operating files include `../references/anchors/bootstrap.md`, `../references/anchors/agents.md`, and this memory tree.
- `workspace/operations/` remains the registry and operations payload area after materialization.
- Canonical policy source remains repository policy files; workspace copies are applied runtime artifacts.

## Runtime Scripts

- `memory/runtime/tasks/scripts/activate-runtime-memory.sh`
- `memory/runtime/tasks/scripts/deploy-operations-artifacts.sh`
- `memory/runtime/tasks/scripts/restart-governance-runtime.sh`

## Source Canon

- `../references/anchors/.hermes.md`
