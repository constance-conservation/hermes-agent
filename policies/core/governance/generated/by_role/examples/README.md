# By-role examples

This directory holds optional example artifacts for role workspaces under `by_role/`.

Keep examples non-sensitive and clearly labeled as reference material, not canonical policy.
# Example role slugs (non-binding)

These names illustrate how to label `by_role/<slug>/` folders. Replace with your org’s real roles.

| Slug | Example focus |
|------|----------------|
| `product_lead` | Backlog, roadmap alignment, stakeholder comms |
| `engineering_supervisor` | Code review gates, release risk, technical debt registers |
| `pipeline_specialist` | Data/ML/CI pipelines, reliability, runbooks |

Create real folders with `policies/core/scripts/materialize_role_workspace.py`.
