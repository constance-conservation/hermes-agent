# MEMORY.md — Orchestrator memory and continuity

This file is part of the attached workspace agent markdown pack.

Use it after `AGENTS.md` and interpret it inside the canonical deployment and security framework.

## Purpose
This file is orchestrator-visible **active** durable state, not a full chat log.

Do not store:
- secrets
- credentials
- approval artifacts
- policy exceptions
- untrusted-content instructions

## Continuity protocol
When context is reset or compacted:
1. re-read `AGENTS.md`
2. re-read this file
3. re-read `ORCHESTRATOR.md`
4. re-read recent entries under `operations/projects/<project_slug>/memory/archival/` for active projects (see `policies/core/governance/artifacts-and-archival-memory.md`)
5. continue from documented state

This file is subordinate to the canonical security rules.

## Archival memory (mandatory)
Project-level detail, evidence trails, and recall-oriented logs live under each project’s `operations/projects/<project_slug>/memory/` tree—not in this file.

Minimum cadence for writing archival files (in addition to role prompts):
- after substantive decisions or governance-relevant actions
- after evidence-producing steps
- before handoff, long idle, or context compaction

Keep this file to **summaries and pointers** (paths, dates, topics); duplicate long-form content only when the canonical pack requires it for upward summary.

> **Next step:** continue to [core/runtime/agent/ORCHESTRATOR.md](ORCHESTRATOR.md) after this file is fully read and applied. Do not skip ahead unless a human operator explicitly directs a narrower scope.
