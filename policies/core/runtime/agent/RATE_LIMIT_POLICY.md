# RATE_LIMIT_POLICY.md — Token budgets and compaction

This file is part of the attached workspace agent markdown pack.

Use it after `AGENTS.md` when long-running context, compaction, or orchestration limits matter.

## Purpose
Keep orchestrator and lead sessions within practical model context limits while preserving continuity.

Before aggressive compaction, write or update archival entries under `operations/projects/<slug>/memory/archival/` per `policies/core/governance/artifacts-and-archival-memory.md` so recall is not lost.

This file governs context economy, not security authority.
It must operate inside the canonical deployment and security framework.

> **Next step:** continue to [core/runtime/agent/TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) after this file is fully read and applied. Do not skip ahead unless a human operator explicitly directs a narrower scope.
