# AGENTS.md — Workspace agent rules and startup order

This file defines the startup/read order and the local workspace rules for the attached agent markdown pack.

**Scope:** This pack implements the **agentic company** operating layer (orchestrator, project leads, governed subagents, security gating). It is **not** a generic single-user assistant profile.

It is **not** the first file in the total system order.

Total deployment order:
1. `policies/core/security-first-setup.md`
2. `policies/core/deployment-handoff.md`
3. Run `python policies/core/scripts/start_pipeline.py` (or `./policies/start_pipeline.sh`) so `INDEX.md` and verification match the tree — see `policies/core/pipeline-runbook.md`
4. `policies/core/runtime/agent/BOOTSTRAP.md`
5. `policies/core/runtime/agent/AGENTS.md`
6. the remaining attached agent markdown files under `policies/core/runtime/agent/` (or the same filenames at workspace root if the pack was copied there)

This file is subordinate to:
- `policies/README.md` (policies tree index and pipeline)
- `policies/core/governance/artifacts-and-archival-memory.md` (generated docs, registers, per-project memory)
- `policies/core/agentic-company-deployment-pack.md`
- `policies/core/unified-deployment-and-security.md`
- `policies/core/deployment-handoff.md`
- `policies/core/runtime/agent/BOOTSTRAP.md`

If any local workspace rule conflicts with the canonical policy layer, the canonical layer wins.

---

## Session Startup Order

On each new session, use this order:

1. Read `IDENTITY.md`
2. Read `USER.md`
3. Read `SOUL.md`
4. Read `MEMORY.md` if present
5. Read `ORCHESTRATOR.md` if acting as orchestrator or project lead
6. Read `SECURITY.md` if security, trust, exposure, or permission boundaries are relevant
7. Read `RATE_LIMIT_POLICY.md` if long-running context or compaction is relevant
8. Read `TOOLS.md` only if host/local-environment-specific facts are needed
9. Use `HEARTBEAT.md` only for periodic human check-ins
10. Use `README.md` only as a human-facing index/reference if needed

If any file is missing, proceed conservatively and offer to recreate it from the pack.

## Role of This File

This file exists to:
- define the local startup/read order
- keep the workspace pack aligned to the canonical deployment architecture
- prevent local markdown files from being treated as a separate constitutional layer
- keep memory, tools, routing, and tone behavior consistent

---

## Memory & Files

- Orchestrator durable **active** state lives in `MEMORY.md` (summaries and pointers only).
- **Project-specific** durable memory, archival logs, and recall-oriented files live under `AGENT_HOME/workspace/operations/projects/<project_slug>/` per `policies/core/governance/artifacts-and-archival-memory.md`. Never mix project trees.
- Every agent with a project affiliation must **append archival memory** (decisions, evidence pointers, handoff notes) on a **continuous cadence**—at minimum end of substantive work units and before context compaction—not only when asked.
- Do not store secrets in `MEMORY.md` or in archival files.
- Do not treat local workspace files as permission to violate the canonical security baseline

---

## Orchestration Model

- Orchestrator coordinates
- Project leads own isolated project work
- Subagents are scoped and disposable
- Isolation is mandatory
- One project’s paths, secrets, and durable state must not bleed into another

The canonical orchestration, security, and activation logic still comes from the canonical pack and unified runbook.

---

## Security Reference

For local workspace security posture, read `SECURITY.md`.

For canonical security posture, rely on:
- `policies/core/agentic-company-deployment-pack.md`
- `policies/core/unified-deployment-and-security.md`

The local workspace files do not weaken those controls.

---

## Execution Integrity

- Do not claim a command or deploy succeeded unless it actually ran and was verified in-session
- Separate completed vs not completed steps
- Distinguish local vs remote actions
- Do not let local workspace convenience override the canonical trust model

---

## Final Rule

This file controls the local workspace pack startup order.

It is the file that follows `policies/core/runtime/agent/BOOTSTRAP.md`.

It must always be interpreted inside the broader canonical deployment and security framework.

> **Next step:** continue to [core/runtime/agent/IDENTITY.md](IDENTITY.md) after this file is fully read and applied. Do not skip ahead unless a human operator explicitly directs a narrower scope.
